# The Problem

<div class="section-subtitle">
Urban renewal is expensive, lengthy, and nobody can agree on what "better" looks like.
</div>

Often, people have conflicting ideas they struggle to represent. Councils end up making large decisions from flat 2D sketches.

<!--
Script: This whole thing started with a question — if you have no photos, no floor plans, just some old paintings, can you still reconstruct something meaningful?

The answer was: kind of. The trick was figuring out what SAM actually wants as input. Photorealistic references confused it — too much noise, specular highlights, depth ambiguity. But when you dial the aesthetic toward something cartoonish and flat, the model has a much easier job estimating surface geometry. So I wasn't trying to make art — I was trying to make good training data for a 3D reconstructor.

This took a lot of iteration. Each painting gave a slightly different angle, and I had to reconcile them into a single coherent form before generating anything useful.

<!--
Script: Once I had a stable 3D mesh from SAM, the pipeline became more conventional — Blender for cleanup and camera work, outputting renders that were intentionally kept simple and stylised.

The final step was the interesting one. Rather than leaving it as a static render, I passed those stills back into a Google video generation model and prompted it to add life — people milling around, vehicles, natural movement. The result is what you're seeing now.

It's not photorealistic and it's not meant to be. But it is legible, and it's compelling. People who'd never thought twice about what stood on that street corner suddenly had something they could actually picture. That's the goal — not accuracy, but connection.

# Results From The Weird Tangent

- Keen interest from local heritage organisations in reviving forgotten places.
- Historical reconstruction & invites to festivals 
- Clients within the XR + Immersive Arts fields for repeatable pipelines.
- Integration into my Augmented Reality heritage stack, creating portals into cities.
- Direct contact with archival teams for revival & transformation of history.


While my first demo is still stuck in procurement pipelines.

## The Lesson

I don't know what the lesson here is - I wasted time faffing around with creating something I thought was cool, and wasn't afraid to go on the great tangents I saw.

I'm still trying to balance hte use of AI with this, I think using it to revive forgotten about history & sites lost to time is a great start, and there's so much archival data.
